                A well-designed website is more important than many people realize, especially in today’s visually
                driven market. It significantly increases your chances of success by helping you attract and retain your
                target audience. On the other hand, a poorly designed or unprofessional website can leave a negative
                impression and harm your business.

                An appealing visual design plays a key role in creating a positive first impression. Research shows that
                visitors typically spend seven seconds or less on 90% of the websites they visit. That means you only
                have a brief window to clearly communicate who you are, what you offer, who you serve, and why you’re
                the best choice.
